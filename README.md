# Conversational Chatbot with Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview
This project showcases a Chatbot application built using **Django** as the backend framework and **JavaScript** for the front-end interface. The chatbot leverages the **MistralAI API** for natural language processing (NLP) to deliver a seamless conversational experience. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of cutting-edge AI models into a web application.

## Features
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Users can communicate with the chatbot in real time via an intuitive interface.
<!-- - **Conversation Management:** Conversations are stored and managed efficiently using Django's robust ORM. -->
- **NLP Integration:** The chatbot's conversational abilities are powered by the MistralAI API, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Dynamic Front-End:** JavaScript is used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
### Back-End:
- **Django:** Framework for managing the server-side logic and database interactions.
- **MistralAI API:** Integrated for advanced conversational capabilities.

### Front-End:
- **HTML/CSS:** For the structural and styling components of the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** For real-time interactions and dynamic updates.

### Database:
- Django's default SQLite.
